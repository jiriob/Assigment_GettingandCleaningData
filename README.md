* "CodeBook.md"
* `run_analysis.R`
* "mean_data.txt"
* "mean_grouped_data.txt" 

## CodeBook.md
The codeBook.md discribes extensively how the `run_analysis.R` works and how it cleans the data. the input od this script is already inherenly downloaded by the script itself. The data is provided by Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems at the Laboratory
DITEN - Università degli Studi di Genova. 
* `run_analysis.R`

THE Codebook.md describes how the script run_analysis.R creates the two output files: 
* tidy output data 
	* "mean_data.txt"
